# naural-network-from-scratch

This project aims to build a simple neural network from scratch in python just
for fun.

# Developement

You need `python3` and `gcc` to run this project. You can install
the required dependencies with `poetry`:
```bash
poetry install
```

If you are on Nix, you can use a shell encironment with:
```bash
nix-shell
```

Run with:
```bash
poetry run python -m neural_network_from_scratch
```

# Current State

I just initialized the project and It has just some garbage data in the main. I aim
to work on this project in the following days.
